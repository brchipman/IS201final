            <h2>The Calgary Stampede</h2>
            <h3>Almost every year my family, cousins, aunts, and uncles flock to my grandparents house in Alberta to attend the Calgary Stampede. </h3>

            <h4><p>The Calgary Stampede is the most anticipated event of the year, at least for me. For as long as I can remember, every July we've dusted off our cowboy boots and put on our cowboy hats for the Stampede. The Stampede experience is honestly indescribable, but I'll try to explain the magic anyway.</p><p>For 10 days, everybody in Calgary is outfitted from head to toe in Cowboy attire, the hat, the boots, the belt buckles, the whole shebang. Calgary comes together to celebrate rodeo heritage. For my family, the highlight has always been the Chuckwagon races. 36 wagons compete over the course of 10 days for the Rangeland Derby title. It's the most thrilling thing you'll ever watch. I love every aspect of the Stampede. I love walking under the tunnel to get to our seats. I love the smell of the dirt track. I love cheering until I lose my voice. I love the thundering of the boots as the chuckwagons come around the final bend. Most of all, I love doing all that with my family. There's nothing else like it!</p></h4>
